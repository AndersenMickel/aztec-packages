# Sumcheck Implementation

Let \f$ P_1, \ldots, P_N \f$ be multilinear polynomials in \f$ d \f$ variables. We also refer them as Honk polynomials. 

Upon obtaining a round challenge, the prover algorith updates the book-keeping table captured by the variable 'PartiallyEvaluatedMultivariates' introduced in honk::sumcheck::SumcheckProver
