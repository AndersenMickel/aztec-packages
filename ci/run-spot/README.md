Small run-spot typescript project.

Build with 'npm run build' and push when making changes. This keeps the usage simple in CI.

Having a persistent runner has enough moving parts that it felt worth some extra scripting language usage, as well it organically grew from https://github.com/NextChapterSoftware/ec2-action-builder. It aims to be short and easy to read, and can be migrated if desired.
