# This file uses YAML anchors and aliases to prevent repetition of blocks of config:
# https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/yaml-anchors/
#
# Two primary anchors are checkout and setup_env, called as the first step of almost all jobs:
# - checkout: A custom checkout step to reduce the amount of data downloaded to improve speed.
# - setup_env: Sets up the common environment used by all build steps.
#
# Two CCI executors are used:
# - docker (small): Used only to launch external EC2 instances for big workloads. It's the cheapest option.
# - machine (large): Used for building in CCI itself. 4cpus, 15GB has the optimal power/cost ratio.
#
# The docker executor uses a custom image build in `build_image`. It's specifically streamlined for fast download
# with just enough tools to execute the build system, and launch EC2 instances etc.
#
# There are some `join` steps that are just no-ops. They are just used to produce cleaner graph rendering in CCI.

# This build step checks out the code from the repository. It has a hardcoded readonly key to allow the checkout.
# Initially it just fetches the repo metadata for the current commit hash to a depth of 50 commits.
# We need historical commit hashes to calculate diffs between previous and current commits.
# It then checks out the fetched head to actually download the data.
